## My stuff
* First experiment with WebVR: https://mobile-devices-vr.glitch.me

## Cool stuff
* https://lynnandtonic.com/ - awesome landing page, both design and CSS. Resize viewport for various designs.
* Networked WebVR: https://haydenlee.io/networked-aframe/. Try "4-in-one" on desktop to get an idea.

## Ideas what to put here (eventually):
* Links to personal projects
* Links to external interesting stuff
* Some kind of simple theme selector (a la CSS Zen Garden)

How to add `<title>`? favicon?
