Trying to understand some stuff about markdown, github pages, editing in github etc.

ליבי החמודה💖 💙 💚 💛

אבא החמוד והיפה והחכם ואמא החכמה כמוך

רותם כמוכם

וגם אני כמוכם

## Ideas what to put here (eventually):
* CV; can markdown just replace Word?
* Links to personal projects
* Links to external interesting stuff
* Some kind of simple theme selector (a la CSS Zen Garden)

How to add `<title`? favicon?
